Brief description of submitted files: 
kSum.py
- Printing output triplets with three numbers
- includes method bruteforce() for bruteforce serach of corresponding sum
- includes method sorted() for sorted serach of corresponding sum
- includes main() method

1. Implement a brute-force solution. What's the running time of this solution,   as a function of n and k, where n in the length of the input set?   
- Big O or average complexity of bruteforce algorithm will be O(N^3). 

2. think it's possible to do better? Why or why not?   think it's possible to do better? Why or why not?   think it's possible to do better? Why or why not?
- sorted solution is more effective and has complexity O(n^2)
- not sure if it's possible to do better
- it's interesting to implement k-sum algorithm with 2sum or 3 sum as a base case.
